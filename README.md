# Awesome Jev [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

> A curated, source-backed list of projects built with Jev, TypeSafe AI's System One model for fast, typed, probabilistic decisions.

Jev takes program state plus typed questions and returns constrained answers with probabilities. It is designed for software decisions such as classification, routing, scoring, ranking, verification, and guardrails, rather than free-form text generation.

This list favors public source code, concrete Jev usage, clear limitations, and reproducible evidence. The latest review added **52 community projects and resources**, bringing that part of the list to **102**, alongside official resources, provider integrations, and related lists. See the [September 19 research notes](research/2026-09-19.md) for pinned source evidence and review boundaries. Review completed September 19, 2026 (Europe/Istanbul); upstream event dates below are UTC.

## Start here

- **System One shape:** text or structured state + typed questions → constrained answers + probabilities → deterministic application code.
- **Question primitives:** `Choice` selects an option, `Score` evaluates ordered rubric levels, and `Noul` returns a number from 0 to 1 representing the probability of "yes". Review or abstention behavior is defined in application code. See the [primitive reference](https://docs.typesafe.ai/primitives).
- **Input boundary:** the hosted Jev model is text-only. Browser, audio, image, and robotics projects supply extracted text or structured observations, or use separate perception models. Independent multimodal reproductions are listed separately.
- **Good fits:** semantic routing, triage, reranking, rubric scoring, moderation, verification, and low-latency decisions inside bounded workflows.
- **Important caveat:** schema-valid output is not the same as a correct decision. Validate on your own data, calibrate thresholds, keep high-impact actions behind deterministic checks, and provide a human fallback.

## Recent developments

- **September 18: Python SDK 0.7.0.** [Release notes](https://github.com/typesafe-ai/typesafe-sdk-python/releases/tag/v0.7.0) document a breaking serialization change from `msgspec` to Pydantic, a new `response_model` argument, and corrected serialization of `str` subclasses.
- **September 18: OpenRouter listing.** [Jev 1.13](https://openrouter.ai/typesafe/jev-1.13) is listed with a September 18 date. This is a provider listing date, not evidence of a separate new upstream model revision.
- **September 16: Vercel AI Gateway integration.** The [announcement](https://vercel.com/changelog/typesafe-ai-jev-now-available-on-ai-gateway) introduces typed evaluation via AI SDK's experimental `evaluate` API.
- **Current model:** [TypeSafe documents](https://docs.typesafe.ai/models) `jev-1.13.0`, with both `jev-latest` and `jev-preview` currently pointing to it. Pin the version when comparing evaluations.
- **Ecosystem refresh:** new sections cover context pruning, browser/device control, media tools, and provider integrations. Entries newly added here include both September 18 launches and earlier release-week projects missing from the initial list.
